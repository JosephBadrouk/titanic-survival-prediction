# CSI4506
Titanic Survival Prediction using AI and Machine Learning

# Dependencies

* Python3
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Supervised Learning
* Machine Learning Algorithm
* Classification Algorithms
* Feature Engineering

# Usage

Type "jupyter notebook" in the main directory and a browser window will pop up.

# Overview

The data has been split into two groups:

training set (train.csv) 
test set (test.csv) 

The training set should be used to build our machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome for each passenger. Our model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. We will also use feature engineering to create new features and help us categories multiple attributes together.

# Goal

Show a simple example of an analysis of the Titanic disaster in Python.

# Data Dictionary 

* Passenger: Passenger number 
* Survived: Indicates if the passenger survived: 0 = no, 1 = yes 
* PClass: The ticket class: 1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class 
* Sex: The passenger's sex: Male, Female 
* Age: The passenger's age, in years 
* SibSp: Number of siblings / siblings related to the passenger that are also aboard the Titanic 
* Parch: Number of parents / children the passenger has that are also aboard the Titanic 
* Ticket: The passenger's ticket number 
* Fare: The passenger's fare 
* Cabin: The cabin number the passenger is staying in 
* Embarked: The port where the passenger embarked: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton 

# We will be showing

* Data Handling
* Importing Data with Pandas
* Cleaning Data
* Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib
